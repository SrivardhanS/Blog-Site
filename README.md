Building a Full-Stack Blog Platform with React and SQL for Startups
In today’s startup ecosystem, a robust content platform can set you apart. Here’s a quick rundown of building a full-stack blog platform using React, MySQL, and Express, which is flexible, scalable, and allows users to create dynamic, engaging content.

Key Features:

Homepage: Fetches all posts from the MySQL database. Posts are categorized (e.g., Business, Innovation, Lifestyle).
Single Post View: Clicking a post shows its content along with author details. Only the owner can edit or delete the post.
Rich Text Editor: Integrated with ReactQuill for styling, users can format text and upload images.
Image Storage: Images are stored on a server, with only the URL saved in the database.
Post Categories: Categories like Finance, Sustainability, and Health & Wellness help organize content, with the URL updating dynamically based on category selection.
Sidebar Recommendations: Shows similar posts based on the current post's category or the author’s other posts.
Routing: React Router DOM is used for smooth navigation between pages.
Authentication & Authorization: Using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure access, ensuring only the post creator can edit or delete content.

Backend (API):
The backend uses Express to interact with MySQL.
User Table: Contains user info (id, username, email, password).
Post Table: Stores post details (id, title, description, category, and image URL).
Images are stored on a server while their URLs are saved in the database for easy access.

Authentication Flow:
JWT is used for authentication and authorization. Once logged in, the user’s JWT token is stored in cookies. This token confirms the user's identity and controls access to edit/delete functions.
User data like email, id, and username are stored in localStorage to manage session states across components.

Security & Data Management:
Bcrypt.js encrypts user passwords.
Posts and user data are managed through SQL foreign keys, ensuring data integrity. If a user is deleted, all their posts are deleted, providing an organized content lifecycle.
